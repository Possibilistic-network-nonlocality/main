# Possibilistic approach to network nonlocality 
This repository is a tool to explore the results exposed in our article https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13526.pdf. 
The paper proposes moving away from probabilities and focusing on possibilities to investigate network's local, quantum, and non-signaling models. The authors aim to determine which patterns of possible and impossible events are compatible with a given network structure. They present various methods to address this question, such as using the inflation technique, SAT solvers, and efficient combinatorial algorithms.\
Here can be found the study of the triangle network and the square network (both for the case of binary outputs and without inputs. 
In this context, the underlying marginal compatibility problem can be expressed as a SAT problem. We use here **Z3**, the theorem prover from Microsoft Research https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3. \
In a first time, we generate all the possible patterns associated to the concerned network from the **MATLAB** script **network_orbit.m** that will group them into orbits of the underlying symmetry group by using **REPLAB** https://replab.github.io/web/index.html. The list of representatives of each orbit can be found in **data/orbit.csv**. Secondly, the classification is done by running the **main.py** that will search a local model for each of those representatives based on the constraints defined within **local_model**, the remaining nonlocal patterns are identified as non-signaling according to the non trivial constraints defined from the inflated newtorks in **inflations**. The final classification will be saved in the file **data**.
